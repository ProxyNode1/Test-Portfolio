<h2>My top 3 favorite movies, right now</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</h3>
<p>Love the look of the world. Love the narrative themes. Love the cinematography. Love the music. Love the pacing. There is a small section in the early mid part of the movie which kinda slows down the pacing quite a bit and Im not particularly fond of it.</p>

<h3>Children of Men (2006)</h3>
<p>All the good things as BR 2049. There is a moment almost at the end which is just peak art, imo.</p>

<h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>Love everything except the story.</p>
